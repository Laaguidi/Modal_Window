# Modal window

This is an implementation of modal window in a generic web page, made with the objective of studying and learning how to manipulate CSS classes using JavaScript.

Functions were created to open and close the modal window by removing and adding a 'hidden' CSS class from the modal window element. An event listener was also included so that the modal window is closed when the Escape key is pressed.
